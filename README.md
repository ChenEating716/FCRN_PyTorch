PyTorch Implementation of paper "Deeper Depth Prediction with Fully Convolutional Residual Networks"



## Introduction

This is a original implementation of [Deeper Depth Prediction with Fully Convolutional Residual Networks](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7785097/) based on PyTorch (1.12.0). This paper addresses the problem of estimating the depth map of a scene given a single RGB image using a fully convolutional architecture.



**Code will be uploaded in the near future.**
